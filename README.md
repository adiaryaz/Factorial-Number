# Factorial-Number

A program to calculate a number's factorial, displaying the full multiplication series down to 0!.

## 📝 Description

This program resolves factorial problems. The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. Factorials are commonly used in combinatorics, probability, and algebra.
The formula to determine factorial numbers is:
n! = n × (n−1) × (n−2) × ⋯ × 1

For example:

**5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120**

**3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Input:** 
- A non-negative integer, n.

**Output:** The program must show the series of factorial operations and the result in a specific format.

**Rules:**
- The input must be a non-negative integer.
- The output format must be: n x (n-1) x ... x 1 x 0! = result.
- If the input is negative, the program should output an error message.
